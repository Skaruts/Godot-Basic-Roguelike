- [ ] UI attack/defense values only update after player's first move.


------------------------------------------------------------------

- [x] While hugging a north or south wall and holdning up or down key, respectively, the the player can then move left or right without updating the turn.
- [x] Player's doesn't leave a corpse when he dies.
- [x] PROBLEM: When entities overlap each other, they all still get rendered, and it's visually messy. (Temporarily (or permanently) fixed by adding a black background to the fonts).
- [x] Debug visuals are hidden behind tiles now (because of the above fix with the font's opaque background).
