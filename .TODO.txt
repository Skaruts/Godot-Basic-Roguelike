#### To do

>>>		Make Corpse a component, rather than an entity on its own
>>>		Revert the player back to a simple entity (not mob - because it's conflicting with mob groups)
>>>		Show combat feedback in the UI Log (currently being printed to stdout)

>>		build a UI

>>		Implement map objects, obstacles, interactibles
>>		Implement items, inventories, enemy drops
>>		Implement doors

>>		Implement a TileMap node (to see if it performs better, when playing and switching textures)
> 		Make mobs move randomly when idling
>		Improve the combat system
> 		improve the icon (change it)



#### Done
* added _solid_ property to tiles (no longer using collision map)
* Converted arrays to 1D arrays (fovmap, tilemap)
	- noticeable performance gain
	- tilemap is now a dict of vector2 keys - trying it out ( tilemap[Vector2(y, x)] )
