------------------------------------------------------------

- [x] 		add _solid_ property to tiles (stop using collision map)

- [x] 		Convert arrays to 1D arrays (fovmap, tilemap) (noticeable performance gain)
- [x] 		Make the tilemap a dict of vector2 keys, try it out ( `tilemap[Vector2(y, x)]` )
