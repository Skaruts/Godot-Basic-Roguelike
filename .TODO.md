- [ ] Show a health bar in the UI
- [ ] Add a second sprite to Tiles and Entities, so they can have a background color.


- [ ] Consider making Corpse a mob component, rather than an entity on its own
- [ ] Consider reverting the player to a separate Entity (as a Mob it's conflicting with mob groups)

- [ ] Show combat feedback in the UI Log (currently being printed to stdout)
- [ ] Build a UI

- [ ] Implement map objects, obstacles, interactibles
- [ ] Implement items, inventories, enemy drops
- [ ] Implement doors

- [ ] Implement a TileMap node (to see if it performs better, when playing and switching textures)

- [ ] Improve Corpse decay with ColorRamp

- [ ] If the window is maximized when switching font, make the window stay maximized
- [ ] Make mobs move randomly when idling
- [ ] Improve the combat system
- [ ] Improve the icon (change it)
- [ ] Add a textured tileset, and implement suport for it (it's not just one more bitmap, it's an alternative tileset for each font size, I think)

------------------------------------------------------------

- [x] add _solid_ property to tiles (stop using collision map)

- [x] Convert arrays to 1D arrays (fovmap, tilemap) (noticeable performance gain)
- [x] Make the tilemap a dict of vector2 keys, try it out ( `tilemap[Vector2(y, x)]` )
